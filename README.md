- You'll see the Token Holder Dashboard

## 🎯 How It Works

### Current Workflow
1. **Generate Ideas**: CEO Agent creates $1M business ideas
2. **Token Holder Vote**: Approve/reject ideas via dashboard
3. **Research Phase**: Research Agent analyzes approved ideas
4. **Product Development**: Product Agent creates detailed concepts
5. **CEO Validation**: CEO Agent evaluates product concept for market viability
6. **Token Holder Vote**: Approve/reject product concepts via dashboard
7. **Marketing Strategy**: CMO Agent develops marketing plans
8. **Technical Strategy**: CTO Agent creates technical architecture
9. **Marketing Agent**: Receives strategy from CMO and executes campaigns
10. **Head of Engineering**: Receives technical strategy from CTO and creates Bolt prompts
11. **Developer Agent**: Receives prompts and opens Bolt.diy for website development

## 🔧 Recent Updates & Fixes

### Phase 2: Revenue Integration (September 2025)
- ✅ **Smart Contract Integration**: Connected Avalanche AVAX Dividend Distributor contract
- ✅ **Automated Revenue Distribution**: 80% to company, 20% to token holders on project completion
- ✅ **Finance Agent**: New AI agent that handles revenue analysis and distribution
- ✅ **Revenue Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of dividends, distributions, and token holders
- ✅ **Web3 Service**: Complete blockchain integration with ethers.js
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Revenue tracking, token holders, and project completions
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Full finance management REST API
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Tabbed interface with Agent Dashboard and Revenue Dashboard

### Agent Flow Fixes (September 2025)
- ✅ **Fixed 404 Error**: Resolved server endpoint issues causing agent communication failures
- ✅ **Complete Agent Flow**: Fixed workflow to properly trigger all agents in sequence:
  - Research Agent → Product Agent → CMO Agent → CTO Agent → Head of Engineering
- ✅ **Backend Stability**: Fixed CMO and CTO agents to handle missing research data gracefully
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Updated frontend to properly trigger subsequent agents after each step

### What Was Fixed
1. **Server Restart Required**: The main issue was a server process that needed restarting
2. **Agent Flow Logic**: Updated `developProduct()` function to call `triggerCMOAndCTO()` instead of stopping
3. **Error Handling**: Fixed agents to handle empty research data without crashing
4. **Route Parameters**: Corrected agent method calls to pass proper parameters
5. **React State Timing Issue**: Fixed critical issue where agents weren't triggering due to React state update timing - now passes data directly between functions

### Current Status
- ✅ All agent endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Complete workflow from idea generation to bolt prompt creation
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback data
- ✅ Real-time agent activity tracking in UI

## 💰 Revenue Integration

### How Automated Profit Sharing Works

1. **Project Completion**: When AI agents complete projects (websites, marketing campaigns, etc.)
2. **Revenue Calculation**: Finance Agent calculates estimated revenue based on project complexity
3. **Smart Contract Distribution**: 
   - 80% goes to company wallet (operational costs, development)
   - 20% distributed proportionally to all token holders as dividends
4. **Blockchain Recording**: All transactions recorded on Avalanche blockchain
5. **Real-time Tracking**: Revenue Dashboard shows live dividend balances and distribution history

### Revenue Sources
- **Website Deployments**: 0.1 AVAX base + complexity bonuses
- **Marketing Campaigns**: 0.05 AVAX base + channel bonuses  
- **Product Launches**: 0.2 AVAX base + feature bonuses
- **Custom Projects**: Variable based on scope and value

### Token Holder Benefits
- **Automatic Dividends**: Receive AVAX proportional to token holdings
- **No Manual Claims**: Pull-based system - claim dividends when ready
- **Transparent Tracking**: View all distributions on blockchain explorer
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on AI agent decisions and company direction

## 🎨 UI Redesign (Latest Update)

### Design Philosophy
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean, professional interface inspired by modern design systems
- **Terminal Theme**: Agent activity section uses black/red color scheme for autonomous/degen vibe
- **Neutral Color Palette**: Replaced colorful gradients with sophisticated grays, whites, and blacks
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy and spacing

### Key Changes
1. **Background**: Changed from colorful gradient to clean white/light gray (`#f8f9fa`)
2. **Cards**: White backgrounds with subtle borders instead of translucent glass effects
3. **Buttons**: Minimalist design with neutral colors and subtle hover effects
4. **Agent Activity**: Terminal-style section with black background and red accent colors
5. **Typography**: Improved font weights, sizes, and spacing for better readability
6. **Color Scheme**: Consistent use of grays (#374151, #4a5568, #6b7280) and blacks (#000000, #1a202c)

### Technical Implementation
- Updated `client/src/App.css` with complete redesign
- Maintained all functionality while improving visual hierarchy
- Added terminal-style monospace fonts for agent activity
- Improved responsive design and accessibility
